<p>Welcome to Elisha's Bakes, a family-run business dedicated to creating delicious and inclusive cakes for all to enjoy. Our passion for baking began with the struggle of finding affordable gluten-free cakes that didn't taste like they were missing something.</p>

<p>We were determined to create cakes that were just as tasty as traditional ones, but without the gluten. We wanted to share our love of baking and bring joy to those with dietary restrictions, so we started experimenting with gluten-free recipes and found that they could be just as delicious as their wheat-based counterparts.</p>

<p>At Elisha's Bakes, we believe that everyone should be able to indulge in high-quality cakes, regardless of dietary restrictions. That's why we offer a range of normal and gluten-free cakes, using only the finest ingredients to create mouth-watering treats that taste just as good as they look.</p>

<p>In addition to our gluten-free options, we also provide non-gluten-free cakes for those who do not have dietary restrictions but still appreciate a good cake.</p>

<p>We take great care in creating our cakes, from selecting the freshest ingredients to putting the finishing touches on each creation. Whether you're looking for a classic Victoria sponge, a gluten-free chocolate cake, or any other special cake, we have something for everyone.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering Elisha's Bakes for your cake needs. We look forward to sharing our passion for baking with you and your loved ones.</p>
